# Financial Complaints Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer complaints data from a financial institution to understand complaint volume, resolution efficiency, dispute patterns, and product-level risk areas.  
The goal is to convert raw complaint records into actionable insights that support customer service improvement, regulatory compliance, and operational decision-making.

The dashboard is built in **Power BI** using a dataset containing **75,075 records and 18 columns**.

---

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions receive a high volume of customer complaints across products, regions, and issue types.  
Without a structured analytical view, it becomes difficult to:
- Track resolution efficiency
- Identify recurring issues
- Monitor dispute escalation
- Allocate resources effectively

This dashboard provides a single, interactive view of complaint performance and trends.

---

## Objectives
- Monitor overall complaint volume and trends
- Measure responsiveness through timely response rates
- Track unresolved and in-progress complaints
- Analyze dispute escalation rates
- Understand product-wise and region-wise complaint concentration
- Support data-driven decisions for customer service and compliance teams
